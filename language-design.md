**Question**

The Pavlus article mentions the researchers' comments that people preferred
"natural-language replacements for some of the more abstruse syntax". In other
words, people found it easier to work with code that looks more like a human language (e.g.,
English). Consider the following quote by William R. Cook, one of the creators
of AppleScript:

> The experiment in designing a language that resembled natural languages (English
> and Japanese) was not successful. It was assumed that scripts should be
> presented in “natural language” so that average people could read and write
> them. … In the end the syntactic variations and flexibility did more to confuse
> programmers than to help them out. It is not clear whether it is easier for
> novice users to work with a scripting language that resembles natural language,
> with all its special cases and idiosyncrasies. The main problem is that
> AppleScript only appears to be a natural language: in fact, it is an artificial
> language, like any other programming language. … even small changes to the
> script may introduce subtle syntactic errors that baffle users. It is easy to
> read AppleScript, but quite hard to write it.

Are these two experiences of natural languages at odds with one another? Would
you choose to include natural language in the design of a DSL? If so, how might
you do so? If not, why not?
